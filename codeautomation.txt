
Drop Down:
---------------------------
WebElement product =driver.findElement(By.id("products-orderby"));
        Select option = new  Select(product);
        option.selectByIndex(3);
        option.selectByVisibleText("hghhb");
        option.selectByvalue("login");

How do you run selenium webdriver test from the command line?
For that go to cmd-> java-class path(of the selenium project) ->hit enter
--------------------------------------------------------------------
File Upload:

1. by using sendkeys also upload  .sendkeys("path");











---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
absolute xpath: start with /. root node to the node. Navigate each and every node. developer change the elements, xpth also change.
relative xptah: jump to the element. mostly use this.
/  absolute path (It find the WebElement from the top of the downstream.)
//  relative path (It find the WebElement from that particular tag.)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Screenshot : 

                File tmp = driver.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
		File dest = new File("./screenshots/one.png");
		FileUtils.copyFile(tmp,dest);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mouse Over : 

Actions a = new Actions(WebDriver ref name);
Actions action = new Actions(driver);
       WebElement element=driver.findElement(By.linkText("computers"));
       action.moveToElement(element).perform();
       action.clickAndHold().release().perform();
       action.doubleClick().perform();
       action.dragAndDrop(element, element); // here we need to give the elements 


action.doubleClick(element).build().perform(); // doubleClick
action.contextClick(element).build().perform(); // right click

action.moveToElement(element).build().perform(); // mouse over action



If we use one method to perform we use perform();
If we use more than one method in one line of code we use build().perform()
perform() compailing the action
build)() creating the action

Action: it is interface, store an action functionalities.

         WebElement destination2 =  preeti.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id=\"box101\"]"));
         act.dragAndDrop(source2, destination2).moveToElement(destination2).release().build().perform(); // it used for drag,drop and release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Waits:
---------------------------------------------
implicit wait :  wait till max time out mentioned in method. before action perform before time out. works for "nosuchelement exception".
 Implicit Wait
Whenever we need to find webelement in webpage, if the webelement is not present, 
before throwing the exception it will wait for the given time. When the webelement appeared 
the program will resume and it wont wait for the time to complete

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitwaits(Duration.ofseconds(60));

Explicit Wait: Webdriver wait until condition ocuures, only applied for specified conditions.
For the given condition to be satisfied or for finding the webelement till that we can 
make our program to wait

WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(30));
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(element));

WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(60));
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIspresent());

Default time for implicit and explicit wait is 500 milliseconds
fluent wait:
Wait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<>(driver)
 .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30)) 
 .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5)) 
 .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);
---------------------------------------------------------------

Navigation commnds:

driver.navigate().to(url);
driver.navigate().forward();
driver.navigate().back();
driver.navigate().refresh();
----------------------------------------------------
xpath- you can take top to bottom and bottom to top values
css selector - take only one top to bottom
waits = using for synchronization purpose
you are not giving any priority that will execute first.
listener:
methods: on scrept, on test sucess, ontest failure.
object repository  : contains all the webelements
repository : specify the all webelements into one location
run through Command:
mvn clean test or install

TestNg annotations - control the order of the execution
Q) Boundary Value Analysis:
Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) is a software testing technique that involves testing the input values on the boundaries of the allowable ranges. 
The goal of BVA is to identify defects and errors in software by testing input values near the edge of the valid and invalid partitions of a system 123.

For example, if a system accepts ages from 18 to 56, the following test cases can be designed using BVA:

Invalid (min-1)
Valid (min, min + 1, nominal, max – 1, max)
Invalid (max + 1)
Here, every partition has its maximum and minimum values, and these maximum and minimum values are the boundary values of a partition. A boundary value for a valid partition is a valid boundary value, and a boundary value for an invalid partition is an invalid boundary value 1.

BVA is based on testing the boundary values of valid and invalid partitions. The behavior at the edge of the equivalence partition is more likely to be incorrect than the behavior within the partition, so boundaries are an area where testing is likely to yield defects. It checks for the input values near the boundary that have a higher chance of error 1.

Build:
-------
Uncomplete software, piece of software either under developer or tester,
Release
----------
 finally done by the testing then released the software to the production or custemer.

backlog: contains the requirement. one sprint take 2 to 3 weeks depends on projects.
----------------------------------------
product backlog: all the stories collected from product manager.
sprint backlog: taken specical or some of stories to the sprint.
Assertion:
------------------------
Asserion is a validating point.  If you want compare something. fail or pass
Dataprovider:
===============
execute same method with different set of data, the data provided by the another method. that method annotated by the data provider method.
POM:
----------
Reusability
10 elements we need to write in pom page, if in future need any attribute chnage easily change the attribute.

priority:
-------------
how much soon close the defect. it is related to the time.

severity:
------------------
impact or seriouness of the application.

*logo slightly different and smelling mistake- low priority, low severity.
* crashing the application rare cases - high severity, low priority we can test other functionalities.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agile:
epic: collection of stories.
stories: contains task.

sprint review meeting: after completing sprint. discussing sprint backlogs, defects.
story point: estimation, how many hours take to complete.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
test design techniques:
 
------------------------------------------------------------
Final:
* variable is final can't change the value.
* method is final can't change the override the child class.
* class is final can't extend the one class to another class.
method overloading: sanme method name with different parameters. It is related to polymorphism. it is possible with single class and multiple classes.
overriding : same method name with same parameters. here atleast we have one parent and one child class. here we will change the implementation part, not changing return type, parameters.

ACCS is the regional clearance solution for FedEx APAC. 
It supports brokerage, cage & warehouse operations, billing for ancillary charges plus scanning and sortation, to some extent. 
The solution has historically evolved from a standard implementation to a percountry deployment with very elaborate modifications and adaptations.
Since there are thirteen separate code bases exists, it has now become difficult to adequately respond to business and regulatory demands. 
As a matter of fact, only regulatory requirements are considered for realization today
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.

Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.

Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.

dry run:
===========
Quickly identifies missing step definitions, helping you to fix them before running the full test suite.

if dry run is true--Skip Execution: It will not execute any of the steps, so no actual testing is performed.
Identify Missing Steps: Quickly find out if there are any steps in your feature files that do not have matching step definitions.

if dry run is false-- It will run the actual test steps, executing the code in your step definitions.
Full Test Execution: Runs the complete test suite, allowing you to validate the functionality of your application.

POM- It is design pattern.

Git PULL, FETCH, MERGE:
======================================
Purpose: git pull is used to fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository into your current branch. It's a combination of two commands: git fetch (which fetches changes) and 
git merge (which merges those changes into your working directory).
The git pull command is used to update your local working branch with commits from the remote repository. It's essentially a combination of two commands: git fetch followed by git merge
git fetch is used to download commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repository without merging them. This command allows you to 
see what changes are available before integrating them into your branch.

GITHUB COMMANDS:
====================== ===================
git init

Advantages of swagger:print first name and last name in java
To print the first name and last name in Java, you can write a simple program. Here's an example to get you started:

java
public class NamePrinter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define first name and last name
        String firstName = "John";
        String lastName = "Doe";

        // Print first name and last name
        System.out.println("First Name: " + firstName);
        System.out.println("Last Name: " + lastName);
    }
}
In this example, we define two string variables firstName and lastName, and then use System.out.println() to print them. You can change the values of firstName and lastName to whatever you want!

If you have any more Java queries or need help with something specific, feel free to ask.

i given myname="battala preeti" print first name and last name
Sure thing! If you have myName set to "battala preeti", you can split it into first name and last name in Java. Here's how you can do it:

java
public class NameSplitter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the full name
        String myName = "battala preeti";

        // Split the full name into first name and last name
        String[] nameParts = myName.split(" ");
        String firstName = nameParts[0];
        String lastName = nameParts[1];

        // Print first name and last name
        System.out.println("First Name: " + firstName);
        System.out.println("Last Name: " + lastName);
    }
}
This program splits the full name myName into parts using the split(" ") method, which divides the string at spaces. Then, it prints out each part separately.

Give it a try, and let me know if you need any more assistance!

find duplicate elements in java
To find duplicate elements in a Java array, you can use a few different approaches. Here's a simple example using a HashSet to identify duplicates:

java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class DuplicateElementsFinder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1};

        // Create a set to store unique elements
        Set<Integer> uniqueElements = new HashSet<>();
        // Create a set to store duplicate elements
        Set<Integer> duplicateElements = new HashSet<>();

        for (int element : array) {
            // If element is already in uniqueElements, add to duplicateElements
            if (!uniqueElements.add(element)) {
                duplicateElements.add(element);
            }
        }

        // Print duplicate elements
        System.out.println("Duplicate elements: " + duplicateElements);
    }
}
In this example:

We use a HashSet called uniqueElements to store unique elements of the array.

Another HashSet called duplicateElements stores elements that are found to be duplicates.

We iterate through the array, trying to add each element to uniqueElements. If add() returns false (meaning the element is already present), we add it to duplicateElements.

Finally, we print the duplicate elements.

You can modify the array values to test with different inputs. If you have any specific requirements or need further explanation, feel free to ask!

another way
Sure, another way to find duplicate elements in a Java array is by using a nested loop. This approach is straightforward but less efficient than using a HashSet, especially for large arrays. Here's how you can do it:

java
public class DuplicateElementsFinder {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1};

        System.out.println("Duplicate elements: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < array.length; j++) {
                if (array[i] == array[j]) {
                    System.out.print(array[i] + " ");
                    break; // Break to avoid printing the same duplicate multiple times
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
In this example:

We use two nested loops to compare each element with every other element.

If a duplicate is found, it prints the duplicate element and breaks the inner loop to avoid printing the same duplicate multiple times.

This method is simpler but has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it less efficient for large arrays. If you need any further explanation or additional methods, feel free to ask3




what is the difference between static and final keyword in java
Great question! Both static and final keywords are fundamental in Java, but they serve different purposes. Let's break down the differences:

static Keyword:
Class-Level: The static keyword is used to define class-level fields and methods. This means they belong to the class, not to any specific instance of the class.

Shared Among Instances: A static variable or method is shared among all instances of the class. Changes to a static variable affect all instances.

Access Without Instance: Static members can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. You can directly use ClassName.staticMember.

Static Methods: A static method cannot access instance variables or methods directly. It can only call other static methods and access static fields.

Example:
java
public class Example {
    static int staticVariable = 10;

    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }
}
final Keyword:
Constant Variables: The final keyword is used to create constants. Once a final variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed.

Immutable Classes: When used with classes, the final keyword prevents the class from being subclassed (i.e., no other class can extend it).

Method Inheritance: When used with methods, final prevents the method from being overridden by subclasses.

Thread Safety: The use of final can help ensure thread safety when working with variables in multi-threaded environments.

Example:
java
public class Example {
    final int finalVariable = 20;

    final void finalMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a final method.");
    }
}
Combining static and final:
You can combine static and final to create a class-level constant.

Example:
java
public class Example {
    static final int CONSTANT = 100;
}
In summary, static is used for class-level members that are shared among all instances, while final is used to create constants and prevent changes to variables, methods, and classes. If you need any more examples or further explanation, just let me know!

string methods
Strings in Java come with a rich set of methods that you can use to manipulate and work with text data. Here are some commonly used string methods:

length(): Returns the length of the string.

java
String str = "Hello";
int length = str.length(); // 5
charAt(int index): Returns the character at the specified index.

java
char ch = str.charAt(1); // 'e'
substring(int beginIndex) / substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex): Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.

java
String subStr1 = str.substring(1); // "ello"
String subStr2 = str.substring(1, 3); // "el"
contains(CharSequence s): Checks if the string contains the specified sequence of char values.

java
boolean contains = str.contains("ll"); // true
indexOf(int ch) / indexOf(String str): Returns the index within the string of the first occurrence of the specified character or substring.

java
int index = str.indexOf('l'); // 2
equals(Object obj) / equalsIgnoreCase(String anotherString): Compares two strings. The second method ignores case considerations.

java
boolean isEqual = str.equals("Hello"); // true
boolean isEqualIgnoreCase = str.equalsIgnoreCase("hello"); // true
toUpperCase() / toLowerCase(): Converts all characters in the string to upper or lower case.

java
String upper = str.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO"
String lower = str.toLowerCase(); // "hello"
trim(): Removes any leading and trailing whitespace.

java
String trimmed = "  Hello  ".trim(); // "Hello"
replace(char oldChar, char newChar) / replace(CharSequence target, CharSequence replacement): Replaces each occurrence of the old character or target sequence with the new character or sequence.

java
String replaced = str.replace('l', 'p'); // "Heppo"
split(String regex): Splits the string into an array of strings based on the provided regex delimiter.

java
String[] parts = str.split("e"); // ["H", "llo"]
compareTo(String anotherString) / compareToIgnoreCase(String str): Compares two strings lexicographically.

java
int comparison = str.compareTo("Hello"); // 0 (equal)
valueOf(): Converts different types (int, double, boolean, char, etc.) to a string.

java
String numberStr = String.valueOf(123); // "123"
These methods can help you effectively manipulate and handle strings in your Java programs. If you need examples or explanations of any specific methods, just let me know!

String str="1000";
Got it! With the string str assigned the value "1000", you can perform various operations on it. Here are a few examples:

Convert to Integer:

java
int number = Integer.parseInt(str);
System.out.println("Integer value: " + number); // 1000
Check Length:

java
int length = str.length();
System.out.println("Length: " + length); // 4
Concatenate with Another String:

java
String newStr = str.concat(" is a string");
System.out.println(newStr); // "1000 is a string"
Check if Numeric:

java
boolean isNumeric = str.matches("[0-9]+");
System.out.println("Is numeric: " + isNumeric); // true
Convert to Array of Characters:

java
char[] charArray = str.toCharArray();
System.out.println("Character array: " + Arrays.toString(charArray)); // ['1', '0', '0', '0']
Compare with Another String:

java
String anotherStr = "1000";
boolean isEqual = str.equals(anotherStr);
System.out.println("Is equal to '1000': " + isEqual); // true
These examples illustrate some of the many ways you can manipulate and work with the string "1000" in Java. If you have any specific operations or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

String str ="1000"; String str="2000"; print 3000
It seems like you're trying to add the values of two strings and print the result. To achieve this, you need to convert the strings to integers, perform the addition, and then print the result. Here's how you can do it in Java:

java
public class AddStrings {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "1000";
        String str2 = "2000";

        // Convert the strings to integers
        int num1 = Integer.parseInt(str1);
        int num2 = Integer.parseInt(str2);

        // Add the integers
        int sum = num1 + num2;

        // Print the result
        System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum); // The sum is: 3000
    }
}
In this example:

We define two string variables str1 and str2 with the values "1000" and "2000".

We convert these string values to integers using Integer.parseInt().

We then add the two integers and store the result in sum.

Finally, we print the result.

Run this code, and you'll get the output 3000. If you need more help with Java or have any other questions, feel free to ask!

what is the main difference between static and final keyword
Certainly! While both static and final are important keywords in Java, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's a summary of their main differences:

static Keyword:
Class-Level: The static keyword is used to define class-level fields and methods. This means they belong to the class, not to any specific instance of the class.

Shared Among Instances: A static variable or method is shared among all instances of the class. Changes to a static variable affect all instances.

Access Without Instance: Static members can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. You can directly use ClassName.staticMember.

Static Methods: A static method cannot access instance variables or methods directly. It can only call other static methods and access static fields.

Usage in Blocks: static can also be used to define static blocks that are executed when the class is loaded.

Example:
java
public class Example {
    static int staticVariable = 10;

    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }
}
final Keyword:
Constant Variables: The final keyword is used to create constants. Once a final variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed.

Immutable Classes: When used with classes, the final keyword prevents the class from being subclassed (i.e., no other class can extend it).

Method Inheritance: When used with methods, final prevents the method from being overridden by subclasses.

Thread Safety: The use of final can help ensure thread safety when working with variables in multi-threaded environments.

Example:
java
public class Example {
    final int finalVariable = 20;

    final void finalMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a final method.");
    }
}
Combining static and final:
You can combine static and final to create a class-level constant.

Example:
java
public class Example {
    static final int CONSTANT = 100;
}
Key Differences:
static is about associating members with the class itself rather than with instances. It's used to define class-level variables and methods, meaning they are shared across all instances.

final is about immutability and restriction. It's used to declare constants, prevent inheritance, and prevent method overriding.

pom and page factory
Sure! Let's break down the concepts of Page Object Model (POM) and Page Factory in the context of Selenium WebDriver:

Page Object Model (POM)
Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern used in test automation to create an object repository for web UI elements. The main idea is to create a separate class for each page of the application under test (AUT)1. This class will contain the web elements and methods to interact with those elements. The advantages of using POM include:

Reduces code duplication: By centralizing the web elements and methods, you avoid repeating code across different test scripts.

Improves test maintenance: If the UI changes, you only need to update the page object class, not the individual test scripts.

Enhances code readability: The methods in the page object class have meaningful names that describe the actions they perform.

Page Factory
Page Factory is a way to implement the Page Object Model. It is a factory class provided by Selenium WebDriver that helps in initializing the web elements of a page object2. The Page Factory uses annotations like @FindBy to locate web elements, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. Here's a simple example:

java
import org.openqa.selenium.support.PageFactory;
import org.openqa.selenium.support.FindBy;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;

public class LoginPage {
    private WebDriver driver;

    public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {
        this.driver = driver;
        PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
    }

    @FindBy(id = "username")
    private WebElement usernameField;

    @FindBy(id = "password")
    private WebElement passwordField;

    @FindBy(id = "loginButton")
    private WebElement loginButton;

    public void enterUsername(String username) {
        usernameField.sendKeys(username);
    }

    public void enterPassword(String password) {
        passwordField.sendKeys(password);
    }

    public void clickLogin() {
        loginButton.click();
    }
}
In this example:

The LoginPage class represents the login page of the application.

The @FindBy annotations are used to locate the web elements.

The PageFactory.initElements(driver, this) method initializes the web elements.

Key Differences
POM: A design pattern that represents a web page and its elements as a class.

Page Factory: A way to implement POM by using annotations to initialize web elements.

Using POM and Page Factory together helps create a more organized, maintainable, and reusable test automation framework.

Does this help clarify the concepts for you?




finally keyword
The finally keyword in Java is used in conjunction with a try-catch block to ensure that a block of code is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. This is particularly useful for cleanup operations like closing files, releasing resources, or cleaning up connections, which must happen whether an error occurs or not.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the use of finally:

java
public class FinallyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Code that may throw an exception
            int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw an ArithmeticException
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            // Handling the exception
            System.out.println("Caught an exception: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            // This block will always execute
            System.out.println("This is the finally block. It always executes.");
        }
    }
}
In this example:

The try block contains code that might throw an exception.

The catch block handles the ArithmeticException.

The finally block contains code that will execute no matter what, even if an exception is thrown and caught.

Output:

Caught an exception: / by zero
This is the finally block. It always executes.
Even though an ArithmeticException is thrown and caught, the finally block executes and prints its message.

Key Points:
Guaranteed Execution: The finally block is always executed after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.

Resource Cleanup: Commonly used for resource cleanup like closing files, releasing network connections, or cleaning up memory.

The finally block ensures that important cleanup code runs no matter how the try block exits. If you have more questions or need further examples, let me know!

pull and petch commnads in github
It seems like there might be a typo in your question. Did you mean git pull and git fetch commands in GitHub? If so, here's a brief explanation of each:

git pull Command
The git pull command is used to update your local working branch with commits from the remote repository. It's essentially a combination of two commands: git fetch followed by git merge. Here's how you use it:

sh
git pull origin main
This command fetches the latest changes from the main branch of the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

git fetch Command
The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Unlike git pull, it doesn't automatically merge the changes into your current branch. You can use it like this:

sh
git fetch origin main
This command fetches the latest changes from the main branch of the remote repository but doesn't merge them. You can then manually merge the changes using git merge if needed.

git format-patch Command
If you meant git format-patch, it's used to create patches from commits. Patches are text files that describe changes made to the code3. Here's an example:

sh
git format-patch -1 HEAD
This command creates a patch for the last commit.

Does this help clarify things? If you meant something else, please let me know!




pull and fetch commands use in git
Absolutely, let's delve into the git pull and git fetch commands in Git. These commands are essential for collaborating with remote repositories and managing updates to your local copy of the project.

git pull
Purpose: git pull is used to fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository into your current branch. It's a combination of two commands: git fetch (which fetches changes) and git merge (which merges those changes into your working directory).

Usage:

sh
git pull origin main
This command will fetch the changes from the main branch of the origin remote and merge them into your current branch.

Example:

sh
git pull origin main
Here, origin is the name of the remote repository.

main is the branch you want to pull changes from.

git fetch
Purpose: git fetch is used to download commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repository without merging them. This command allows you to see what changes are available before integrating them into your branch.

Usage:

sh
git fetch origin
This command will fetch all the changes from the origin remote but will not merge them into your current branch.

Example:

sh
git fetch origin
This command fetches updates from the remote repository named origin.

You can then review these changes with commands like git log or git diff.

Key Differences:
Merging: git pull automatically merges the fetched changes into your current branch, whereas git fetch only downloads the changes and doesn't merge them. You need to manually merge the changes with git merge after fetching.

Control: git fetch gives you more control over what you want to merge and when you want to merge it. This can prevent unintentional changes from affecting your local branch.

Workflow Example:
Fetch Changes:

sh
git fetch origin
Review Changes (optional):

sh
git log origin/main
git diff origin/main
Merge Changes:

sh
git merge origin/main
Using these commands effectively helps in maintaining a smooth workflow while collaborating on projects with multiple contributors. If you have any more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!
